#### 2. Familiarize yourself with the switch interface by figuring out the meaning of the following commands. (Note that you can always type a question mark, e.g. show?, after a command, so that the command is not executed, but you can see what kind of additional commands can be entered.)

    - • Find out how to navigate the different command modes of the router (user, priviledge, global configuration and specific configuration)
    - • Try shortening commands e.g. ena instead of enable, etc.
    - • Try completing commands with the tab key

**User mode** : User mode can be identify by the **>** symbole and when you first enter to the CLI mode you are in the user mode. You can switch between **User mode** and **Exe priviledge mode** by using commands **enable** and **disable**.

**Exe priviledge mode** : The **Exe priviledge mode** can be identified by the **#** symbole.
